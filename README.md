# fetchASeat

Welcome to the Fetch-a-Seat experience!

This app calls to the SeatGeek API and in effect allows you to search real live events-happening now (please attend these events safely and follow all local health guidelines).

It features URL Session, JSON decoding, local persistence of favorites, List, NavigationView, a DetailView, small and large photos, plus my first Easter Egg.

It uses SwiftUI, is cocoapod-free and was made in Brooklyn!

You've got to run it to believe it!

Thanks for the consideration!
