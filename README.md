# fetchASeat

Welcome to the Fetch-a-Seat experience!

This app calls to the SeatGeek API and in effect allows you to search real live events happening now (please attend these events safely and follow all health guidelines)!

I have included: URL Session, JSON decoding, 

2.) Local Persistence of favorites
3.) Easter Egg (a timely coincidence)
4.) List
5.) NavigationView
6.) DetailView
7.) API pulldown from SeatGeek

You've got to run it to believe it!

1.) New tech: SwiftUI
2.) Cocoapod-free
3.) Made in Brooklyn

Thanks for the consideration!
